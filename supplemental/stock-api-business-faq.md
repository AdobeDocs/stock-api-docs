<a id="what-are-the-api-calls-limits"></a>

Individual integration doesn’t require validation. If you create integration for your own use, your integration can work without being approved for production use.

If you create an application and need users to sign into their accounts so they could use their own entitlements to purchase Adobe Stock licenses, then this integration would be limited to 25 users signing into Adobe at the same time. To allow more concurrent logins, you would need to apply for a Production key.

<a id="definitions-and-terms"></a>
## Definitions and terms

Here are the definitions of some standard acronyms and terms used throughout this document.

**POD.** Print-on-Demand

**DAM/MAM.** Digital Asset Management/Media Asset Management

**API.** Application Programming Interface

**SMB (Small/Medium Business) account model.** Entry-level option for Print-on-demand. Requires a low upfront purchase and offers basic options.

**Standard content.** For the purposes of this document, Standard content is a group of images (photos, vectors and illustrations) which consist of Adobe Stock's micro-stock collection, [hosted here](https://stock.adobe.com/images). All assets in this class can be licensed for one credit with a Standard license (see below), and this license allows downloading the asset at full resolution. 

__Standard license.__ This is a limited type of license offered on most Stock assets, including all Standard content (see above). Under the Print on Demand model, a Standard license may be used to print one good. This is different from Extended licenses, which may be used for unlimited prints, but at a much higher cost. For more details see [Adobe Stock License Information](https://stock.adobe.com/license-terms).

**Enterprise account model.** Offers advanced options and volume pricing for Print-on-demand. Requires an Adobe Enterprise contract.

**OAuth integration.** A technical workflow in which users must login to Adobe Stock to authorize their licenses. This is the only method available for the SMB account model.

**Service Account integration**. A technical workflow where the application can authenticate to Adobe Stock without any human user interaction. This method is only available for Enterprise accounts.

## DAMs FAQ

<a id="do-i-need-to-sign-a-contract-to-build-my-dammam-platform-integration"></a>
### Do I need to sign a contract to build my DAM/MAM platform integration?

This type of integration typically doesn’t require signing a contract. The Stock API is free and open to any developer who creates an Adobe ID (personal) account and can be used to search for Stock assets and download watermarked previews.

Further, the developer can create an Adobe OAuth integration, which will allow end-users to sign in and access their own accounts. From here, they can license new assets or download previously licensed assets from their license history.

If the DAM provider needs to create an integration for an Adobe Enterprise customer, some additional steps will be required. Please contact us for more information on this use case.

Adobe Stock is working with multiple DAM partners to create new integrations, but currently the only available integration with the [Adobe Experience Manager](https://www.adobe.com/marketing/experience-manager.html) (AEM) Assets platform. If you are an AEM user, see [more information here](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kt/assets/using/adobe-stock-aem-assets-technical-video-setup.html).

Adobe will be happy to work with any platform provider or customer who wishes to create a new integration, and can provide technical support, sample code and architecture guidance, but does not have the resources to perform the integration work. If necessary, Adobe can recommend some third-party firms who can be engaged to create the integration.
